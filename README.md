# HttpSpy
A tool to easily reconstruct HTTP requests sent by the client.

## Usage
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotDSF/HttpSpy/main/init.lua"))();
```

## Why should you use this?
Unlike other HTTP spies, mine serializes the request with the information sent.

## Should you use this to penetration test?
Simple answer, No. There are multiple detection methods for this, and I made this for private use.
